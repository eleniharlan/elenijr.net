What is it? It's a good question, tucked away in the long list of cornmeal-related breads in Bill Neal's excellent Southern Cooking book from North Carolina.

Essentially, you mix 2 tbsp cornmeal with 2 tbsp water, then drop it into hot fat and fry it. In my cast iron biscuit pan, it was ideal. We used the fat we skimmed off from the pan juices of our roast chicken, and it was incredible. Like a cross between crisps and roast potatoes, but way easier to produce than either of those. If you're not worried about heart disease, and can't be bothered to make roasties with your next Sunday roast, I recommend.
