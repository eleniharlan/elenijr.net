### When does an idle afternoon become cemented in your memory as a most treasured moment of your life?

In Richard Linklater's recent film _Boyhood_, the story of a young man's upbringing is told by focusing on the little moments in life, not the main events. I think that if you do see the movie of your life in the final moments of it, then it would be moments like the ones in that film. One of my most treasured memories is a quiet afternoon on a secluded beach, tossing pebbles into the Aegean with my three siblings. The shared moment seems to hang in the air in total stillness, suspended there with no sense of time passing.

Food is often something we do when we are filling time, waiting for something to happen. But then in our memories, it is the warming bowl of soup, the freshly baked loaf, the perfectly ripe watermelon which remains in our memory and is forever associated with it. So I was not surprised when Jenny Diski, who recently shared [her cancer diagnosis](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n17/jenny-diski/a-diagnosis) with the world, finds [this comforting memory](http://jennydiski.wordpress.com/2014/09/16/wasting-our-time/) amongst the jumble and trauma of her crazy childhood:

> There they were. Bubbelehs, not just a private name for the delicious treat Bubba always cooked when she came to visit, but the pancakes of suddenly Proustian importance, made simply from matzo meal and egg, moulded into patties, fried and then dusted with cinnamon and sugar.
