My first week back at work after the holidays was a bit unusual- instead of biking into central London to go to the office, I took a flight from North Carolina to Austin, Texas to train people in [a behaviour change tool](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/06/a-therapy-created-to-treat-addiction-is-being-used-to-reduce-car-reliance/373212/) to get people to consider other alternatives to their car for daily trips. I'd never been to Austin before -or Texas for that matter- and it has a distinct reputation preceding it (for being 'weird', for being hip, for being 'an island of blue in a sea of red', etc.). I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time to explore, and I wouldn't have access to a car so I'd expected to only be able to go to places within walking distance. So I broke from foodie ritual and did not make a list, or even do a search for local blogs. I came as innocent as they come to the city that gave birth to the likes of SXSW, Whole Foods, and food trucks. But in my limited time, and my limited view, I did want to know- was Austin all mouth and no trousers? 

##An urban geographer's dream
One thing I loved about Austin was how walkable (and bikeable) everything was. I was staying in a hotel on Riverside, just across the river from downtown. My room had a glorious view of the river, and across from it City Hall and all the high rises of the city.

I had pretty low expectations of what I'd find in the downtown. Downtown American cities tend to be a bit of a wasteland- windswept canyons of glass and steel, dotted with the interminable Starbucks at the corner of every block. A friend who used to live in East Austin told me it was a boring, cookie cutter place- and I'm sure that compared to some of the hipper neighbourhoods, it totally was. But there was plenty of life and interesting places to pass the time; the Starbucks' were still there, but the independent shops, cafes and breakfast taco joints far outnumbered them.

##Foodies galore

I was in good company in Austin. People had things to say about food, and an appreciation for the good stuff. I was lucky too in that one of my training attendees was a big foodie- she owns [her own bakery](http://www.knottynice.com/), as well as holding down a full time job at the City, raising a kid and doing a PhD (man, she made me feel lazy!). 

###It's nacho cheese

On the first night my hosts took me to an 'old' hotel on 6th Street, The Driscoll. It was very grand, complete with marble floors, and massive stuffed longhorn cows' heads in the bar. Monday night happy hour was ridiculously cheap, but otherwise pretty unridiculous. With our martinis, we ordered the Texan bar snack stalwart, "queso". As far as I can tell, this is typically melted plastic cheese with bits in. I've had some pretty plasticy versions before, but this one was actually encouragingly cheese-like. The tortilla chips that came with it were freshly fried, something I wish was the status quo for nachos in the UK rather than the nasty dorito-style packaged ones. It makes such a big difference.

###Wholey smokes

Texans are a proud folk, and Austinites are fiercely proud of their city.
