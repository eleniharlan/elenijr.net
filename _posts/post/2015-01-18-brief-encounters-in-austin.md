My first week back at work after the holidays was a bit unusual- instead of biking into central London to go to the office, I took a flight from North Carolina to Austin, Texas to train people in [a behaviour change tool](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/06/a-therapy-created-to-treat-addiction-is-being-used-to-reduce-car-reliance/373212/) to get people to consider other alternatives to their car for daily trips. I'd never been to Austin before -or Texas for that matter- and it has a distinct reputation preceding it (for being 'weird', for being hip, for being 'an island of blue in a sea of red', etc.). I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time to explore, and I wouldn't have access to a car so I'd expected to only be able to go to places within walking distance. So I broke from foodie ritual and did not make a list, or even do a search for local blogs. I came as innocent as they come to the city that gave birth to the likes of SXSW, Whole Foods, and food trucks. But in my limited time, and my limited view, I did want to know- was Austin all mouth and no trousers? 

##An urban geographer's dream
One thing I loved about Austin was how walkable (and bikeable) everything was. I was staying in a hotel on Riverside, just across the river from downtown. My room had a glorious view of the river, and across from it City Hall and all the high rises of the city.

I had pretty low expectations of what I'd find in the downtown. Downtown American cities tend to be a bit of a wasteland- windswept canyons of glass and steel, dotted with the interminable Starbucks at the corner of every block. A friend who used to live in East Austin told me it was a boring, cookie cutter place- and I'm sure that compared to some of the hipper neighbourhoods, it totally was. But there was plenty of life and interesting places to pass the time; the Starbucks' were still there, but the independent shops, cafes and breakfast taco joints far outnumbered them.
