## Sweet heat

Friday was one of those blazing hot summer days in London (I'm certainly not complaining). After a busy day at work I stopped by [Ali Baba Juice](http://alibabajuice.tumblr.com/) for something refreshing. They had some new combinations since the last time I'd been–– they were out of the plum and star anise soda but that's definitely on my list for next time. I tried a watermelon, red pepper and aloe vera juice on ice instead. I was skeptical at first; I love watermelon but not a big fan of its juice, but I was intrigued by the combination of sweet and savoury. Chris (Mr Ali Baba himself) said his inspiration was using hot pepper but without the burn.

Slowly rolling down Peckham Rye Lane on my bike, sipping this concoction in the late afternoon sun, I got thinking about fruit/spicy combinations. I had a big ripe mango at home, half a cucumber and some jarred red peppers and put together a mango salsa which reminded me of that juice and a salad with grilled chicken, mango and coriander that my mom's friend used to always make for us when we went over there for lunch as kids. I doused my salsa in a scotch bonnet hot sauce I bought in a Cuban sandwich shop in North Carolina (yes, really) and we ate it with sticky rice and fried plantain: a perfect lazy Friday dinner.
