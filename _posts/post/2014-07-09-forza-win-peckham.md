I went to a wedding on Saturday night, which meant I spent Sunday feeling a bit fragile and mainly lolling about and intermittently watching the tennis. 

But it was a gorgeous sunny day and I had heard through the [grapevine](http://peckhampeculiar.tumblr.com/) that this new Italian meat grilling warehouse had opened and were doing a cheap meaty lunch which sounded just about perfect.

The Sunday menu was very straightforward: grilled meats on sticks, a choice of lamb, pork, beef or chicken. Comes with an open-face DIY sandwich (a bun with some green stuff and caramelised onions) and a side salad of orechiette with pesto.

We sampled the lamb, pork and beef, with an excellent glass of the house wine which was a lovely unfiltered, slighlty cloudy white.
