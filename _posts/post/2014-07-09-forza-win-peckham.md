I went to a lovely wedding last Saturday, which meant I spent Sunday feeling a bit fragile and mainly lolling about and intermittently watching the tennis. 

But it was a gorgeous sunny day and I had heard through the [grapevine](http://peckhampeculiar.tumblr.com/) that this new [Italian meat grilling warehouse](http://www.forzawin.com/) had opened and were doing a cheap meaty lunch which sounded just about perfect.

The Sunday menu was very straightforward: Â£5 gets you a grilled meat on a stick with a choice of lamb, pork, beef or chicken. Comes with an open-face DIY sandwich (a bun with some green stuff and caramelised onions) and a side salad of orechiette with pesto.

We sampled the lamb, pork and beef, with an excellent glass of the house wine which was a lovely unfiltered, slighlty cloudy white.

I went back last night for one of their family-style dining ticketed events, the best way I can describe it is audience participation supper club. The communal tables and shared platters lend themselves to mingling, but there was something a bit contrived about it as well: people pointedly introducing themselves to their neighbours; a 'speech' delivered at the beginning by a member of staff telling you where the loos and fire exits are. But the vibe was decidedly fun and the crowd was there for a night out, not a meal.

This is certainly a good addition to Peckham; a racuous venue for those who love food and can make a night of eating it accompanied by a concise but by no means under-used booze selection. The staff were all young, enthusiastic and knew their stuff, and I was impressed that the guy who served us on Sunday when he was even more hungover than us remembered me when I went back on Thursday.

Welcome to the neighbourhood Forza, I'm sure you will not struggle to find friends and indeed regulars.
