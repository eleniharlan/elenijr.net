## Grillin

A few weeks ago we went to North Carolina to visit my family, and to meet the family's latest addition baby Alexis, or as we call him, Bebis. 

North Carolina has a strong barbequeing culture, which mainly revolves around pork- it is the home of pulled pork or as it's often called, whole hog BBQ. They are pretty serious about the whole hog thing. One local establishment boasts 'everything but the squeal' ––and you need only order a side of [scrapple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapple) to know they are serious.

Despite the abundance of excellent places to eat meat, good butchers are few and far between. So I was excited to check out the newly opened [Rose's Meat Market and Sweet Shop](http://rosesmeatandsweets.com/), another in the wave of small independent food businesses popping up all over regenerating downtown Durham.
