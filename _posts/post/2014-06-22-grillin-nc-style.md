## Grillin

A few weeks ago we went to North Carolina to visit my family, and to meet the family's latest edition baby Alexis or as we call him Bebis. 

North Carolina has a strong barbequeing culture, which mainly revolves around pork- it is the home of pulled pork or as it's often called, whole hog BBQ. They are pretty serious about the whole hog thing. One local establishment boasts 'everything but the squeal' ––and you need only order a side of [scrapple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapple) to know they are serious.
