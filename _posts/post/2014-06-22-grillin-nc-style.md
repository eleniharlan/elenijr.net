## Grillin

A few weeks ago we went to North Carolina to visit my family, to meet the latest addition: baby Alexis, or as we call him, Bebis. 

North Carolina has a strong barbequeing culture, which mainly revolves around pork- it is the home of pulled pork or as it's often called there, whole hog BBQ. They are pretty serious about the whole hog thing. One local establishment boasts 'everything but the squeal' ––and you need only order a side of [scrapple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapple) to know they are serious.

### Culottes and cakes

Despite the abundance of excellent places to eat meat, good butchers are few and far between. So I was excited to check out the newly opened [Rose's Meat Market and Sweet Shop](http://rosesmeatandsweets.com/), another in the wave of small independent food businesses popping up all over regenerating downtown Durham. I'm not sure what the provenance is behind the combo of meats and sweets (sweetbreads? sweet meats?) but the shop gave the impression that there was one. In any case the meat counter was well supplied, there was butchery on demand, and although I didn't sample any, the cakes did look nice. 

The young butcher recommended the culotte steak, a common cut in Argentinian steak houses which has a thick layer of fat on the top and is grilled whole then cut into thin slices. The fat is charred so that it melts into a crackling like consistency before flipping over the meat
