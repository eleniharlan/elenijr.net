### When does an idle afternoon become cemented in your memory as a most treasured moment of your life?

In Richard Linklater's recent film Boyhood, the story of a young man's upbringing is told by focusing on the little moments in life, not the main events. I think that if you do see the movie of your life in the final moments of it, then it would be moments like the ones in that film. One of my most treasured memories is a quiet afternoon on a secluded beach, tossing pebbles into the Aegean with my three siblings. The shared moment seems to hang in the air in total stillness, suspended there with no sense of time passing.

My brother Niko would have been 35 today. I can probably count on one hand the number of birthdays I remember sharing with him in the last years of his life. Indeed, Linklater would maybe be amused that what I remember about him turning 29 for example is the run up to the day, rather than the day itself. That summer Niko and I found common bonds in literature and in food. Always a fussy eater, the steroids he'd been prescribed made him more open minded than he'd ever been about flavours and textures and I delighted in introducing him to things he'd never been interested in before. This led to detailed plans and instructions for his birthday meal, transmitted via email because I was still in Greece and he was back in the States. Even though I couldn't be there on the day he found a way to make me a part of it.

The movie of Niko's life would be full of these tender and thoughtful moments, sharing a new culinary experience, listening with earnest interest to stories people had to tell, making humble yet astute observations about everything all around him as he grabbed onto life with every bit of energy he had. His energy, still with me, propels me forward. What he did not get in years he made up for in moments.
