title: "World's best pork chop"
---

If you ever needed another reason to visit the beautiful country of Greece, here's one. The Honey Tree taverna on the sleepy, pine-covered side of the island of Aegina is certainly off the beaten track, although its proprietors have served their expertly-grilled meats, home-grown salads and rustic olives and wine made on the premises with many famous figures- indeed, it is apparently where you'll find Varoufakis and the rest of the once top brass in Syriza, although Tsipras himself has not yet made it there. 

Kirios Nikos, the owner and grill master was sourcing his meat from local farms and growing his own tomatoes long before anyone called themselves a foodie. As he gets older, each year I wonder if I will see him the next, but am also reassured by seeing his two grown children, and indeed his granddaughter, taking up the mantle. He's still reluctant to hand over the grill though, and I don't blame him. The pork chop or _brizola_ is the best I've had, each and every time.

As the gloom of Autumn rains encroach on London, I often daydream about long afternoons spent in the shade of The Honey Tree, sipping on their cold red wine, and waiting for the chop to come off the grill.
