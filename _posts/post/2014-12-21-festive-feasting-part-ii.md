For our second feast, the order of the day was to feed 23 extended family members, and the theme was Greek food. 

Again there was going to be very little preparation time so I went for things that could be made in advance and left in the fridge to be whipped out at the last minute. Luckily, a lot of Greek food (especially in winter time) is designed to be made in bulk, and last a long time just for these kinds of scenarios.

We decided to do an array of vegetarian meze to start with, and then a massive piece of slow-roast pork with potatoes. There was also a moussaka and a spanakopita that others contributed to the feast, and something for the vegetarians too.

##The meze

For the meze, because I was feeding non-Greeks but grecophiles, I wanted to do a mixture of classics and slightly more out-there dishes. Alongside a big 'politiki' cabbage and carrot salad, we also had some simple things like hummus, beetroot mutabal, Moroccan aubergine zaalouk, and cooked and sliced beetroots served with skordalia- a potato and raw garlic spread that you serve with boiled vegetables, grilled meats and fish. 

I used Maria Elia's skordalia recipe- I'd never made it before and was once again astounded at the amount of olive oil used (it's nearly equal weight of potato and olive oil) - reinforcing the conclusion that the true secret to Greek food is vast quantities of the good liquid gold.
