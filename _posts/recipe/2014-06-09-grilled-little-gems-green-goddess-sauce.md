## Grilled little gems, green goddess sauce

A few years ago I was spending some time in LA, specifically in Westwood where my brother was doing medical treatment at UCLA. We mainly hung around Westwood Village and quickly cycled through the three decent places to eat there. Getting bored of pizza, bibimbap and Trader Joe's ready meals, one day I stumbled across [fundamental LA](http://fundamental-la.com/) and instantly realised it was no ordinary sandwich shop. Oh no. I'm pretty sure their chicken torta would have a high place at the table for any sandwich appreciator. As far as I could deduce, they slow cook the dark meat only and then they put it on a hot flat griddle to crisp up. The bread was hardy enough to sop up all the (many) juices, did not fall apart, but was not a jaw work out either. Pillowy. This sandwich eaten 2+ years ago was certainly an event.

But this is a post about salad, not sandwiches. (I will make that sandwich one day though, oh yes I will.) This place in LA had a special grilled romaine salad with 'green goddess dressing'. It was certainly very green but beyond that I'm not sure. Anyway I had lettuce, and a bunch of green stuff, so I figured I would have a go at recreating it, in honour of the LA-esque weather we've been enjoying...

Indeed, it's summertime here in London and that means one thing for the British: the BBQ. We don't have a bbq but we can still have the affectation, and so we grill things in our kitchen. I love grilling greens, especially delicate things like lettuce or endive. There's something quite satisfyingly perverse about putting a delicate leaf over a hot flame.
