### Hangouttitude in South London
Have I talked about the holy trilogy of South London pubs? I live near the Camberwell Arms, work near the Anchor & Hope, and make solemn pilgrimages whenever I can to the Canton Arms. All under the same loose ownership, each of these pubs has their own signature style, and bucketloads of hangoutittude. One icy cold winter night early in December, I had a pumpkin ribollita at the Camberwell Arms' bar, laced with chilli oil and washed down with a hearty Gamay (all 3 pubs have excellently priced and interesting wines by the carafe) which makes me feel warm all over just thinking about it.

###Ribo-whatta?
So WTF is ribollita anyway? As far as I can tell, it's a stew. The pumpkin was slightly mashed but still retained some shape and its own texture, not quite a puree. So as the weather has been once again presenting its worst the last couple weeks, a warming stew is just what's required and I set out to re-create the Camberwell Arms' genius.
