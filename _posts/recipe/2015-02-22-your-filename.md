Despite some rather encouraging early spring days, I am reminded more often than I would like to be that it is still February, and therefore certainly not spring quite yet. Although mentally I am totally over winter, my body still requires winter nourishments, warm baths, and central heating, so I suppose those scrooges are right. And damn that groundhog too.

In this nearly-not-winter-anymore time, I find myself craving this kind of stew, with its warm meditteranean flavours whispering that soon there will be fresh vegetables to eat, and raw salads, but not quite yet. Like all stews, it's rich and hearty, but it also requires little more than some crusty bread and a crisp salad of bitter leaves.
