## A circumspect Czech heritage	

When someone meets me and asks me where I'm from, I answer them in stages. "I'm from Greece". _Oh, but your accent..._ "well, actually I'm half American too." _Oh I see. So where did you grow up?_ "Well, actually I grew up in Saudi Arabia. But I've lived in England for all of my adult life." _Ah. And how...?_ I've had this conversation so many times that my responses now follow a set structure, depending on how interested the other person is. But even those who know me fairly well get thrown a curve ball when I let out, "Yeah, and my mom grew up in Prague - yeah, in Czechoslovakia as it was then. In fact, she never set foot in Greece until she was 25, because of the political situation." I am sure that one day, Junior Jr. will curse me for this family tendency of not being able to stay put in one country for more than a generation. But, she will benefit from getting to eat the very best each of those cultures has to offer. So, you win some, you lose some.

So being a nomad of sorts is a bit of a mixed bag, but it's no surprise that the thing that's easiest to appropriate is a culture's foods. I grew up eating dinners that ranged from Greek stuffed peppers and tomatoes, Czech goulash, US-style pigs in blankets, to Saudi style shawarmas and kebabs. Against the anonymous background of expat living, it all made sense; but, it still does today. Unsurprisingly, in my family, we don't hold to one set of traditions, but end up making our own.

## Plums

A couple weeks ago I'd made the fabulous [slow-roast lamb shoulder with rose petals and plums](http://instagram.com/p/uVTAEtDyXB/?modal=true) from the Honey & Co. cookbook, which [I'm currently working through](http://elenijr.net/post/book-review-honey-co/). I had a bunch of plums left over from that so it was the perfect excuse to make an old family classic, my mom's _zmolenkovy kolac_ or, Czech fruit crumble cake. You can use any soft fruit that's in season- blueberries and blackberries are a big hit, and nectarines or peaches are fabulous in summer. Plum is a classic autumnal topping though.
