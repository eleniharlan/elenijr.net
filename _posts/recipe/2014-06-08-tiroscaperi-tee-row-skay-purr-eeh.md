## Tiroscaperi

_**Tirokafteri**, or spicy cheese dip is a classic Greek meze typically consisting of feta cheese, yoghurt and some sort of chilli or hot pepper. Each taverna manages to make it slightly differently though–– I've seen versions with pickled pepperoncini peppers, roasted mild red chillies, chilli oil... riffing on Maria Elia's tzatziki variations, this uses garlic tops or 'scapes' to flavour the cheesy dip instead of chilli._

When I'm visiting family in North Carolina, I love to go to the Durham Farmer's Market on Saturdays. Without the space constraints of London, rather than one or two of each kind of produce stall, there are 20 veg stalls dominating and very little to tell them apart. But like any good market, you get to know the producers and you return to the same ones time and time again. My family's favourite is run by Helga who sells a variety of herbs, greens and squashes and has an impressive nursery. The week I was there they also had scapes, which are the curly tops of garlic (or other allium) plants. For a while we thought they were called snapes which I think is a rather amusing misnomer. 

Originally I was going to use them in tzatziki but there was a yoghurt shortage.
