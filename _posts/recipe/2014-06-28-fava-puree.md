## A good week to be Greek

It's been a pretty good week for the Balkans: the Greek national team has gotten through to the World Cup round of 16 in an historic and totally unexpected victory; and in my corner of South East London, Peckham Bazaar has just announced its imminent re-opening.

###P to the Bizzle

Peckham Bazaar is easily one of my favourite restaurants. It manages to strike so many chords for me: rustic, eastern Mediterranean flavours, but refined and elevated beyond what I'm able to produce at home or what you get at even some of the best seaside tavernas in Greece. Chef John Gionleka's taramasalata is creamy and delicate, artfully laureled with bitter herbs and sprinkled with dukkah. Sitting on their sun-trapped terrace eating P Bizzle's food is electrifying- food here is not 'just as good as' the home country, it is both totally different and totally familiar, a product of more than one place of origin, like Gionleka himself (he's originally Albanian, but speaks perfect Greek and I think a handful of other languages). 

I always leave P Baz on a high, not just because I've sampled much of their excellent Balkan wine list but also full of ideas of things I want to try to re-create. But for a long time their fava puree has stumped me. How does he get it so smooth, so smoky flavoured? I tried soaking them for 24 hours before cooking, blending the cooked pulses, even pushing the yellow lentils through a seive, but although always ended up with nice fava, nothing near what PB produce. When Maria Elia finally revealed the secret in her cookbook Smashing Plates, it was so much more obvious than all that- the trick, as with so much Greek cooking, is a bucketload of olive oil.

My housemate at university used to joke that fava was 'poor man's hummus': I think he'll agree that this quantity of olive oil refutes that claim.

###Fava puree with putanesca garnish (adapted from Maria Elia)

1. Put the lentils in fine-holed colander and rinse thoroughly under cold water to get rid of some of the starches.
2. Put the washed fava in a medium sized saucepan along with the onion, garlic, bay and thyme.
