This summer I went to the island of Sifnos, which is a tiny island in the Cyclades known for its dramatic scenery, pottery, and local cuisine. It did not disappoint: in five days, we had some of the most satisfying meals- the kind that this blog tries to capture. The kind that leave a warmth in the pit of your stomach, a little bit like butterflies, but without being nerve-wracking. Like reverting back into the womb, where nothing can hurt you and your only job is to be nurtured.

One such local specialty which epitomised this is _revithada_ (chick pea casserole), which we were lucky enough to sample at a taverna set back from a shady beach called _Fassoula_ (coincidentally, the latter's name derives from the Greek word for bean: hot on the pulse??) in the south of the island. Every Sunday, the taverna fires up its wood burning stove to cook the traditional _revithada_.

What I found so compelling about the dish is how savoury it was and yet so simple. I'm pretty sure the ingredients can't have been more than 4 (olive oil, chick peas, onion, lemon) but the flavours imparted were as rich as any animal based stock I've encountered. 

While the oven was on, they also cooked some other things, like lemon-marinated pork and potatoes.
