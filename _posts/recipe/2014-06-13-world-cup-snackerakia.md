## world cup snakerakia

It's too hot in London to do much cooking this week, but there is plenty of snacking to do. The World Cup lends itself to rustling up some snacks before/during/after/between matches. For some reason my family calls snacks snackerakia. This is not a Greek word but it is in our Grenglish lexicon. 

I watched the last world cup in three countries (this was unplanned). I still remember these [fried breads stuffed with feta](http://www.kalofagas.ca/2010/06/11/perek-or-fillota-%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%BA-%CE%AE-%CF%86%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BB%CF%89%CF%84%CE%AC/) that I ate in 2010.
