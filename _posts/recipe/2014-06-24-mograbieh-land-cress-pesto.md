## Mograbieh

I miss pasta. My partner was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a couple years ago and although he's found a way to regulate most foods, pasta remains ellusive. So when we want something quick and easy for dinner, we have to get a bit creative. 

Mograbieh is one of those grains in the aisles of Khan's and the cookbooks of Ottolenghi that I've never given more than a curious glance at. It's often described as 'giant couscous' which I suppose it technically could be. More endearing I think is a description I read of it being 'like tiny dumplings'. But, more importantly for the sake of convenience, it cooks like pasta.

I had bought some 'land cress' the other day, which has the same bitter, peppery taste as its water-borne cousin, but is much tougher to chew. If chickens eat watercress, maybe cows eat land cress? Anyway it's not really great for salad as a result, but held up well in a pesto type concoction.

## Land cress pesto

Wash the cress well and pat dry. Put the cress in a food processor or moulti and roughly chop with a drizzle of olive oil and a bit of salt to help lubricate it. You want it to be a course consistency, but not total mush. When it's done, transfer to a medium sized mixing bowl.
In a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic and sea salt into a paste. Add the toasted walnuts a handful at a time, and a bit of olive oil too again for the lubricating effect. Dump the garlicky nuts into the bowl with the greens.
Mix everything well together, adding more olive oil as needed and a bit of salt to taste. If you are adding feta, make sure you account for the cheese's saltiness too.

###For the mograbieh

To be honest I've never made it before, so I am far from authoritative. What I ended up doing is cooking it like pasta, until al dente, then leaving it in the liquid for a bit while I got the other things ready. It soaked up more of the water during this time.
