## Mograbieh

I miss pasta. My partner was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a couple years ago and although he's found a way to regulate most foods, pasta remains ellusive. So when I want something quick and easy for dinner, we have to get a bit creative. 

Mograbieh is one of those grains in the aisles of Khan's and the cookbooks of Ottolenghi that I've never given more than a curious glance at. It's often described as 'giant couscous' which I suppose it technically could be. More endearing I think is a description I read of it being 'like tiny dumplings'.
